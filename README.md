This is my variation of a pokedex application written in node + react, using mongoDb, passport, on the backend, stylus and pug on the frontend.
Everything is packed with webpack.
In the application the following modules (packages) were used:
axios, react-fontawesome,
react-select,
pokedex-promise-v2, react-router-dom.
## Installation

    yarn install

## Create build

    yarn  build

## Run the code on a local webserver

    yarn start

 Host to `http://localhost:8080`
